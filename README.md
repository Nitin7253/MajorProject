Wonderlust is a MERN stack Airbnb-style application where users can browse destinations, view detailed property listings, and make bookings. It allows authenticated users to add, edit,
and manage their own listings while also exploring stays uploaded by others. The project focuses on real-world features including user authentication, secure sessions, clean UI, and
responsive design built using React and Tailwind CSS.

The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose, implementing strong validations, error-handling middleware, and structured database relationships between Users,
Listings, Reviews, and Bookings. It uses JWT for authentication, cookie-parser for secure cookies, bcrypt for password hashing, and Multer + Cloudinary for uploading and storing property images.
All routes are protected and optimized for smooth API communication using Axios.

Wonderlust also includes environment-based configuration, reusable components, and a clean folder structure for scalability. The project is deployed using Render for the backend and 
Vercel/Netlify for the frontend, ensuring full production-ready functionality. It represents a complete full-stack project demonstrating CRUD operations, secure APIs, form validations,
image handling, and a polished frontend experience.
